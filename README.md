 AI-Powered Resume Screening System

The AI-Powered Resume Screening System is a web application that automates resume shortlisting using AI and NLP. Built with Streamlit and deep learning models, it allows users to upload PDFs or paste text, then predicts the most relevant job category, identifies hard vs. soft skills, extracts key skills, and suggests relevant job openings via a real-time API.

Resumes are preprocessed (cleaned, tokenized, and padded) and analyzed using LSTM-based models, providing a primary prediction with confidence scores and the top three likely categories. The system also performs skill analysis and classifies profiles as technical or soft-skill oriented.

It supports single and batch processing, displaying results in structured tables with summary statistics and visualizations. Users can download the analysis as a CSV.

A unique feature is job search integration via the Indeed API, generating queries from extracted skills or predicted categories to show relevant openings instantly.

This project showcases practical applications of deep learning, NLP, and web technologies, and can be extended with features like resume-job matching, candidate ranking, transformer models, and cloud deployment.
